# fdtd_1D
1D Finite-Difference Time Domain demonstrations of transmission line phenomena.

This 1-dimensional implementation of the Finite-Difference Time Domain algorithm for electromagnetic waves was developed to demonstrate transmission line concepts.

## fdtd.py
fdtd.py is an 1-D implementation of the FDTD algorithm in Python 3. It allows for the simulating the interactions of a linearly polarized plane wave with dielectric slabs.
